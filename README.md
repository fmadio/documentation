# Introduction

#### FMADIO10

The FMADIO10 packet capture device is our entry level full sustained line rate 10Gbit capture to cache packet capture / packet sniffer devices. It is a compact 1U 650mm deep chassis featuring 7.4 nanosecond resolution hardware packet time stamps and sub 100ns world time accuracy via PTPv2 or GPS. In addition there is 1TB of high bandwidth SSD flash storage which is written back into 16TB of raw magnetic disk drives. The system is unique by combining a hybrid SSD / HDD storage architecture to gain maximum cost savings with maximum disk storage and still be capable of sustained 1TB worth of line rate capture without any packet drops.

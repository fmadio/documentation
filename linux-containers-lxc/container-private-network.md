# Container Private Network

The container can be configured to have a independent public IP address (fully bridged), a private internal IP (internal NAT) or both. All options have Pros/Cons and need to be considered for final deployment.&#x20;

A common setup is to have the container entirely private using nginx as a proxy or iptables to port forward to the container.&#x20;

Block diagram below shows Private only Network Topology

With external access using NGINX proxy such as below.

Or use iptables to port forward packets thru the NAT, such as below

## IPTables Configuration

To enable the NATed bridge between man0 (public) network and the fmad0 (private)network the following IPTables config needs to be set

```
echo 1 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i fmad0 -o man0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i man0 -o fmad0 -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o man0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables-save > /opt/fmadio/etc/iptables.conf
```

Alternatively the following /opt/fmadio/etc/iptables.conf file can be used (requires a system reboot or iptables-restore) to take effect

```
